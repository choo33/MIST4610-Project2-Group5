**Scenario Description:** 
<br />The Charlotte Paddle Club is a rapidly growing recreational sports organization located in Charlotte, North Carolina. The club offers a variety of membership plans that provide access to its pickleball and paddle tennis courts, fitness areas, training sessions, and social events. As membership has expanded, the organization has struggled to manage its increasing operational complexity using spreadsheets and manual processes. To support better decision-making and improve the member experience, the club has committed to implementing a comprehensive relational database.
<br />The database supports all major operational functions of the club. Each Member maintains a profile and can enroll in a Subscription that corresponds to a specific Membership Plan (e.g., Basic, Premium, Family, Unlimited). Members may add family members through Family Add-Ons, creating a structure that captures multi-person household usage. The database also stores Billing History and Payment information so that the club can track revenue, late payments, renewals, and financial performance over time.
<br />The club hosts frequent Club Events, such as tournaments, group lessons, clinics, social mixers, and sponsored gatherings. These events are categorized by Event Type, staffed by designated Staff members, and may be financially supported by external Sponsors. Attendance for each member at each event is recorded through the Attendance entity, enabling the organization to analyze engagement levels, participation trends, and event popularity. The ClubEvent_has_Sponsor relationship records which sponsors supported which events, allowing managers to analyze sponsor involvement and ROI.
<br /> <br />Overall, the database is designed to help Charlotte Paddle Club leaders answer essential managerial questions:
<br />Which membership plans generate the most revenue?

<br />How engaged are members across different events and seasons?

<br />Which staff members manage the highest number of successful events?

<br />Which sponsors create the greatest impact on event participation?

<br />How can the club identify trends in retention, billing issues, and member behavior?
<br /> <br />By centralizing all member, event, financial, and operational data, this system provides the Charlotte Paddle Club with a clean and sustainable structure for future analytics, reporting, and decision-making. The database supports improved membership management, better staffing decisions, optimized event planning, stronger sponsor relationships, and overall operational efficiency.
